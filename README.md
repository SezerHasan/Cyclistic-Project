This repository contains files about the Cycistic Project. This project stems from a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic. Stakeholders therein aim to maximize the number of annual memberships. Thus, my objective is to identify differences between annual members and casual riders, which can turn into a data-driven marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members. At the end of the analysis/report, I will offer tentative campaign ideas to convert subscribers into customers.

The project codes are provided in a .rmd file, which also contains the data source. The repository also has a .pdf version of the project with visuals and analysis.
